## Featured Projects

### [Twins](https://github.com/nickwfarkas/Undergraduate-Coursework/tree/main/CSC-4110-Software_Engineering/Twins-Game)

A game I created for CSC 4110 Software Engineering using the pygame library. This game had a very tight timeline of development under a week. Using pure python, the pygame library, and custom assets.

The goal of the game is to find the sprite ("Twin") that does not have a exact match while they move around the screen in random trajectories. If you choose the wrong twin you lose and your score is the time it takes you to find the twin imposter.

You can try it yourself under the dist folder.

### [Needle Drop AI](https://github.com/nickwfarkas/Undergraduate-Coursework/tree/main/STA-5820-Data_Science/NeedleDropAI)

The Needle Drop is one of the top music personalities on the internet but being only one person, he doesn’t rate every one of the internets favorite albums. Sometimes I wonder what would he rate this? I also have been interested in checking out the YouTube and Spotify open API’s.

If you are a fan of music and the internets busiest music nerd than your love AI tool. This tool scores music singles like Anthony Fantano [The Needle Drop](https://www.youtube.com/@theneedledrop). It does this by utilizing statistical methods such as Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The data was obtained using the Youtube public API.

Presentation and Data included in repo.

### [Train Over Tracks Classifier](https://github.com/nickwfarkas/Undergraduate-Coursework/tree/main/CSC-5800-Intelligent_Systems/Train_Over_Tracks_Classifier)

Trains over tracks is an annoying problem in the micro view but an economic and safety problem in macro view. In 2021 alone there was 2,146 collisions which resulted in 234 fatalities and 670 injuries due to public and private railway crossing (Federal Railroad Administration's Office of Safety Analysis, 2021). Those statistics are not including the drivers that make unsafe decisions on picking another route to go around the track. It also slows down movement to hospitals, local business, and civilian jobs. If the general population had a safe and easy solution to avoid these bottlenecks it would save time, money, and even lives. In review of research done on the problem in particular the U.S. Department of Transportation. Their deep learning-based detection (Federal Railroad Administration, 2022) would not only take thousands of dollars of public spending in infrastructure but does not put safety and information in the hands of the public. The railroad crossing experimented on in this experiment is the Van Horn Crossing in Woodhaven, Michigan (for live views http://rrcrossings.woodhavenmi.org). This railroad crossing is near a high traffic area and is right next to a train depot, so the train stops multiple times a day at all times of the day. Stops ranging from 5 minutes to over an hour.

This train has been impeding traffic in the Woodhaven area for years now with no sign of a economical solution. Using image classification techniques I set out to create a train over tracks classifier that will warn the public if there is train over tracks and to find a different route.

### [Levels.fyi Salary Forecaster](https://github.com/nickwfarkas/Undergraduate-Coursework/tree/main/STA-6840-Applied_Regression_Analysis/Levels_Salary_Forcaster)

Levels.fyi is one of the most popular salary tracking web applications especially among engineers. The concept of the website is simple, individuals post their job title, company, compensation information, etc. Levels.fyi will then display the compensation information to the world with anonymity. The one thing levels doesn’t have, is a tool for is to predict the wages of a specific job given different demographics. Levels.fyi does not have an open API or open data source to get the data required for this project. I deployed the tactic of web scraping for this project. I used open source libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and other data science libraries such as Pandas and SKlearn.

I used both Classification and Regression techniques to accurately predict an individuals salary. Sadly I can never release the data that I used per Levels.fyi terms of service.

__More interesting school projects can be found outside of this monolith repo such as [Angular, PHP, & SQL TODO List](https://github.com/nickwfarkas/TODO-List) and [Analysis of Crime Rate Between Blue and Red States](https://github.com/nickwfarkas/STAT-5030)__

## Thank you!

Love and Pain in this repo.

Most of my Wayne State University programming in one place, some files didn't make it but they are always in my heart.

I find it interesting to look back at my first couple classes and see how ugly my code is but how beautiful it was to me when I was writing it.
